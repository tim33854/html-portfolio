<h1>The best movie according to Tim</h1>

 <h2>My number three top movies of all time</h2>

 <hr/>

 <h3>Beetlejuice</h3>
 <p>This was the funniest and scariest movie I've seen in the whole year</p>

 <h4>Twister</h4>
 <p>This could have been more of a romance it wasn't really scary but it was cool</p>

 <h5>Oppenheimer</h5>
 <p> the father of the atomic bomb</p>
